This is a compatibility-focused fork of the 1.16.5 version of [Jade](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jade), which is a fork of [HWYLA](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/hwyla), which in itself is a fork [WAILA](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/waila). The rabbit hole goes deep, I know. We plan to add compatibilities with the mods we use in our modpacks, but if you have a suggestion, feel free to let us know and we might add it!

## Features

* FE compatability
